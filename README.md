# Twin Player Reactor
Twin Player Reactor is a fast, clean and funny reaction game for two players on the same device.
Challenge your friends (or enemies) to a multiplayer battle of reflexes, wits and knowledge! Great as a bar game, ice breaker or to decide who has to do the dishes.

SinghBrothers, the award-winning and highly appreciated developers of other platforms, now bring to Windows Phones, the most challenging Multi-Player Game EVER!

One of 10 (we continuously add more) exciting mini-games is displayed on screen, and if you think the answer is correct, hit your button faster than your opponent to get a point. But be careful - hit it at the wrong time, and you'll lose one. After a few seconds, the next multiplayer challenge starts - and you can make up for lost points or extend your lead against your adversary!

## TWO PLAYERS ON THE SAME DEVICE
Nobody needs to wait, two players, one device, at the same time! Frantic multiplayer action is guaranteed for all ages! Some of the included mini-games require pure reaction, so the younger you are the better, while other mini-games require knowledge of countries in the world and puzzle-solving skills. Who can be the best in all of them?

## LOTS OF DYNAMIC MINIGAMES
There are 10 mini-games included (more soon!), and they span all sorts of areas. For example: Who can find the sad face in a group of smiley faces? Does the shown capital city really belong to the country? Can the mouse navigate the maze to the cheese? Hit when the screen turns white! Does the Logo image match its name? And there's many more!

## SUPER-CLEAN and SLICK Graphics
Everything in the game has been tested on all kinds of screens, and it runs beautifully on all of them!
